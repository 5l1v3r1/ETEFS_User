# ETEFS_User
Easy Transparent Encrypted File System Based on API-Hooking
ETEFS_User is a transparent file encryption SDK based on API hooking technology. It runs in ring 3 mode. ETEFS_User can encrypt those files containing sensitive data generated by the selected applications, such as Microsoft Word, Excel and Power Point. All files are stored in encrypted form on the disk. The encryption progress is executed at background on-the-fly, and does not change the normal operation behavior of the end user. Because of developing by user mode API hooking technology, without any kernel mode drivers, it is easy to integrate ETEFS_User into your software product in a short development cycle. Besides of the core transparent file encryption functionality, ETEFS_User also provides some extension functionalities that are very useful in developing data security related software product, including a file access control module and an operation event monitor module. With the help of ETEFS_User, software developers can rapidly build various document security products from scratch, like DLP (Data Loss Prevent) system, document right management system and document operation auditing system, etc.
